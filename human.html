                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans have had an almost entirely negative impact on tropical oceans. Beaches everywhere are littered with garbage, washed up by and back into our beautiful tropical oceans. Many countries treat their sewage and then release it into the ocean, which usually works fairly well. However, these sewage plants are often filled with waste past their capacity and not all of it can be treated. This untreated waste is sometimes released into the ocean, which is quite harmful to the many delicate ecological balances necessary for life. Another way that sewage defiles the ocean is what gets washed straight to the ocean in sewage and storm drains in tropical communities. This waste can coat coral reefs and make lifeâ€™s processes very difficult for the whole ecosystem. In 1991, tons of oil were dumped into the Persian Sea (on the edge of a tropical ocean) during the Gulf War. Oil can devastate all life in tropical oceans, as it coats animals as they come to the surface, suffocating and poisoning them. It also blocks light for organisms that use photosynthesis, wreaking havoc on the food chains. In tropical oceans near Japan, much of the sea life is filled with mercury from a large dumping incident in the 1950s. This poisoned many animals and causes defects in humans and animals who eat the fish. Humans have done nothing positive for tropical oceans.
